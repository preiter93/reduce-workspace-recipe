# cargo-reduce-workspace-recipe

`cargo-reduce-workspace-recipe` post-processes `cargo-chef` recipes for workspaces with multiple interdependent members.

## Problem

When using [cargo-chef](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/cargo-chef) on a workspace with multiple members if **one member’s dependencies change all other members get rebuild** irrespective of whether they depend on that member. This is because the recipe, even though it got filtered with `--bin foo`, still contains all workspace members and their dependencies in the manifest and the lockfile. **This causes unnecessary rebuilds of unrelated members**.

## Solution

This crate filters a recipe **after a `cargo chef prepare` step**:

- Keeps only the workspace members that the main member depends on or transitively depends on
- Removes manifests and lockfile entries for unused workspace members.
- Preserves all external dependencies.

## Usage

```sh
cargo-reduce-workspace-recipe --recipe-path-in recipe.json --recipe-path-out recipe-reduced.json
```
