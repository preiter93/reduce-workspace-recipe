//! `cargo-reduce-workspace-recipe` reduces `cargo-chef` recipes for multi-member workspaces by removing dependencies that are unrelated to the targeted member.  
//! This results in improved Docker caching.
//!
//! # Problem
//!
//! Consider a workspace like this:
//! ```sh
//! ├── Cargo.toml
//! ├── bar
//! └── foo
//! ```
//! `bar` and `foo` are completely independent.
//!
//! However, when using [cargo-chef](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/cargo-chef), adding a new dependency to `foo` will still force `bar` to be rebuilt even if you run:
//! ```sh
//! cargo chef prepare --bin bar --recipe-path recipe-bar.json
//! ```
//!
//! The issue is that cargo-chef’s generated recipe still includes all workspace members manifests and lockfiles even those that are unrelated to the filtered member.
//!
//! As a result a change in `foo`’s dependencies invalidates the Docker cache for `bar`.
//!
//! `cargo-reduce-workspce-recipe` fixes that. It post-processes the generated recipe and removes all dependency and lockfile entries that are not actually required by the selected workspace member (directly or transitively). The result is a minimized recipe ensuring that unrelated workspace changes no longer trigger unnecessary rebuilds.
//!
//! # Installation
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo install --git https://github.com/preiter93/reduce-workspace-recipe
//! ```
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! To build dependency recipes for only a specific workspace member, follow this:
//!
//! 1. Prepare a recipe for a single member
//! ```sh
//! cargo chef prepare --bin bar --recipe-path recipe-bar.json
//! ```
//!
//! 2. Reduce the recipe
//! ```sh
//! cargo-reduce-workspace-recipe \
//!     --recipe-path-in recipe-bar.json \
//!     --recipe-path-out recipe-bar-reduced.json
//! ```
//!
//! 3. Cook the reduced recipe
//! ```sh
//! cargo chef cook --release --recipe-path recipe-bar-reduced.json --bin bar
//! ```
